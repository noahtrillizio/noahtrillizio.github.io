        <div class="GameAboutText">
            While attending Bradley University I agreed to make a game for one of my professors Owen Shaffer in an
            independent study. Every year he would pick a couple of students to make games to use in his ever-expanding study 
            on the psychology of how and why games are "fun". I also did this so I could personally get a good grasp of all aspects that go
            into game creation from programming, to design, to sound, and playtesting. This was a very important learning 
            experience I had and taught me a great many things that I use to this day.

        <div style="font-size: xx-large; color: dodgerblue;">Puzzle Design</div>
  
        <div class="GameAboutText">
          The core gameplay loop is the completion of sliding block puzzles, where you are trying to navigate your ship form
          one end of a maze to another.

        <div class="GameAboutText">
          The hardest part of this whole experience was making enough new mechanics and twists that I could put on those mechanics.
          It was both a challenging yet rewarding experience that pushed my design and puzzle skills to their limits and beyond.
          There are 8 different objects that you can interact with and they were used to create 30 different puzzles of varying difficulty.
        </div>
  
        <div class="GameAboutText">
            Aside from the first one, all puzzles are chosen by a <b>dynamic difficulty</b> system.
            This makes it so that whether you are a seasoned puzzle player or less experienced you will be given puzzles more 
            suited to your skill level. Your skills being determined by how quickly you complete each previous puzzle.

      <div class="GameAboutText">
          As a way of getting all the mechanics across I have a short skippable tutorial before each puzzle so that nobody is ever 
          confused about an upcoming mechanic.

      <div style="font-size: xx-large; color: dodgerblue;">Story</div>
  
      <div class="GameAboutText">
        There are technically 7 different stories that you could have when playing this game. Due to the fact that 
        to test for the "fun" value Dr.Shaffer wanted different circumstances for doing these puzzles to see how engaging different
        people found different stories.
      </div>

          Your browser does not support mp4
      </video>
  
        <div class="GameAboutText">
            In order to facilitate these different stories I had to make a dialogue system that you can see above and that I built off
            of for another game I made Doom Mates. Showing one letter at a time until all the text is shown and the audio line is completed
            before letting the player proceed. While it's something I wouldn't do in the future it is something Dr.Shaffer asked me to do
            specifically for his research study.
        </div>
  
        <div class="GameAboutText">
            While you can't hear it now, all the lines from each story are fully voiced by me. I tried my best to give each story its own unique 
            feel and sound. Doing several takes of some lines till I got all the lines to sound as natural as I could.
        </div>

      <img class="GamePlayImageCenter" width="640" height="410" src="images/AudioScreen.png">

      <div class="GameAboutText">
          Since there was a lot of audio involved in this project I was asked to have this screen appear between each puzzle
          and would have a voice line be said with a letter. This was done to make sure people were listening to the story and not muting their 
          computers throught the story. To get accurate data for a questionnaire at the end.
