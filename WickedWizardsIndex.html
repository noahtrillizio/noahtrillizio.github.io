      <div class="GameAboutText">Wicked Wizards is a game that is a culmination of the Bradley Game Design class of 2023.
        It is a 3D Networked Multiplayer Character Based FPS that our 30+ team worked on for nearly a year to perfect to the best of 
        our abilities. This project taught me a lot about working in a large team as well as the many trials and tribulations
        that come with Network Programming.

    <div class="GameAboutBlock">
      <div style="font-size: xx-large; color: dodgerblue;">Login/Database</div>

      <div class="GameAboutText">
        I created and implemented all the networking that occurs outside of the game itself.

      <div class="GameAboutText">
        In this video, you can see there is a login process. This is used to save player settings between sessions
        and to allow us to store statistics and player data in regards to their actions in game. Such as which class
        they prefer to use, how much damage they do as each class, how often they take damage, and other statistics that
        assist with balancing.
      </div>

      <div class="GameAboutText">
        There are also several security measures put into place in order to keep other's accounts safe. Such as
        password inscription and the ability to reset your password if you forget it.

    <div class="GameAboutBlock">
        <div style="font-size: xx-large; color: dodgerblue;">Multiplayer</div>
  
        <div class="GameAboutText">
          This includes the multiplayer relay network that allows for others to play at the same time.

        <div class="GameAboutText">
          While the networking and gameplay using it were handled by other people when you spawn in, I was the one 
          who handled the entire lobby and queuing up system. Allowing you to see all the people who have open lobbies
          as well as allowing you to create your own. 
        </div>
  
        <div class="GameAboutText">
          I was also the one who implemented all of the functionality from the moment you launch the game 
          to the moment you spawn in the game world after reading up.

        <div class="GameAboutText">
          I worked very closely with the VFX artist to implement all of the player-related VFX in a satisfying way.
